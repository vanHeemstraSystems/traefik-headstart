I’ve been using Traefik for a while now, and I’ve helped quite a few people with it, but I still see a lot of people scared off it. This isn’t helped by a lot of guides being incredibly verbose, and not explaining what’s going on very well. Most people I talk to end up just sticking with whatever they’re using already, usually nginx.

Traefik has a bit of an image problem, mostly that it’s far too complex, fiddly and magic for the lowly self-hoster. This image problem is something I’ve been working on trying to change for months. To help do that, here’s a complete getting stated guide for Traefik, to complement and extend my previous Traefik basics post. It’s intentionally verbose, to explain some of the magic going on.
